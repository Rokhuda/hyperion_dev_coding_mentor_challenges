Section A: Code Review

Option 2: Java Task

LINE {1-37}

Correctness: 

- The code attempts to perform two tasks: reversing a string using recursion and generating a Fibonacci series. 
- However, there are several issues with the code that need to be addressed.

Efficiency: 

- The Fibonacci series generation is implemented using a for loop, which is an efficient approach with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the desired number of Fibonacci numbers. - - - - However, the recursive string reversal implementation is not efficient as it creates multiple substrings, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the string.

Style: 

- The code lacks consistent indentation, making it difficult to read. It is recommended to use consistent and proper indentation for better code readability.


Documentation: 

- The code lacks proper documentation.
- Adding comments to explain the purpose of the code, each method, and any important steps would greatly improve its readability and understandability.

Positive aspects: 

- The code attempts to solve the given tasks, and the logic for generating the Fibonacci series is correct. 
- The use of recursion to reverse the string is a good approach, but it needs improvement.

Improvements:

1. Kindly refer to the following documentaion on Java coding standards. https://www.cs.bu.edu/courses/cs112/problem_sets/coding_standards.html

- There are two standard formats for braces, Curly braces delimit the bodies of classes, methods, and loops of which either is acceptable. 
- It is is important to note that both formats can not be used at at the same time. refer to LINE {1, 2 & 12}. This school be consistant through out.

2. Refer to the following documentation https://www.javatpoint.com/java-naming-conventions .
- Use proper naming conventions, such as PascalCase for class names (Recursion instead of recursion). LINE {1}. 
- Go through your code and see if you can spot another class or method name that violates java naming conversion. I bet you can spot one more.

3. Fixing indentation can improve code readability and basic function of the script. Refer to LINE {7, 13, 14, 15 ... }

- I have recommended some formating and linting extention for vs.code and intelli-j however you can broaden yur horizon depending on whts relevent for you or the ide you are using.

4. In most cases, always use comments to explain 'why' rather than 'how' and you are good to go.
- 'How' will tell you how the code works but 'why' will tell you the purpose of the code, what is expected
- Add comments to explain the purpose of the code{}, each method{}, and any important steps{}.

5. consider LINE {20}

- Fix the recursive string reversal implementation to improve efficiency. 
- Instead of creating multiple substrings, consider using a helper method with additional parameters to keep track of the reversal progress.
